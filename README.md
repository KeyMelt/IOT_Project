# IOT_Project
Asset tracking system using Arduino, GPS, GSM, and an accelerometer. Tracks real-time location and detects accidents. Data is sent via GSM to a server for visualization using APIs, MQTT, or Blynk. The project is simulated in Proteus and demonstrates IoT and embedded systems for asset tracking in a university course.
